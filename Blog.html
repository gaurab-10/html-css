            <p>Technology is the use of scientific knowledge to solve practical problems. By looking at the history we
                can see how far we have reached in technology field. Technology can be viewed as an activity that forms
                or changes culture. Additionally, technology is the application of mathematics, science, and the arts
                for the benefit of life as it is known. <br><br>
                A modern example is the rise of communication technology, which has lessened barriers to human
                interaction and as a result has helped spawn new subcultures the rise of cyberculture has at its basis
                the development of the Internet and the computer.Technology has made human life comfortable more than
                ever. Using internet mobiles computer people easily connect with their nearest ones no matter where they
                are.Transportation has made the world like a one city people can move from place to place in shorter
                time like within a day around any part of the globe.Internet has helped a lot of students and teachers
                to learn and teach.<span id="dots">....</span> <span id="textHide"> Internet is the sea of information
                 every thing is found over the internet from household problems to education everything. Social
                medias changed the way of communication among individuals .From young to adult to communicate ,to
                 pass lesiure time or to learn something they often use social media.In a few years, driverless cars
                may be the norm for everyone. There is no denying that the future of technology will continue to
                revolutionize our lives. Technology is influencing and transforming our world from every aspects
                entertainment, education, empowerment, awareness, health, communication, comfort.<br><br>
                 Though technoglogy changed our lives it has also damaged the human life so badly.Digital technology
                 means that vast amounts of data can be collected and stored. So, from cyber attackers or hackers
                people are receiving the threat calls regardimg leaking their personal images, audios, videos.Cyber
                bulling is also the next most dangerous thing over internet . Via social media, attackers attack the
                   innocent young girls and make them victim of girls trafficking.There is an increasing tendency for
                people to socialize and communicate via digital devices rather than through real-life contact. This
                can easily lead to a sense of disconnect and isolation. Human beings have evolved over thousands of
                years to have real contact, so taking that away affects them in all sorts of negative ways that
                we're only just beginning to understand. Studies have suggested that the lack of real-life contact
                 is causing depression and other forms of mental illness in many people.Copying and reproducing
                digital media is very simple. Schoolchildren can simply copy and paste their homework assignments
                without learning anything new.Addiction can be found in social networking, computer gaming,
                chatting, and dating websites where Users end up wasting a lot of time and money in exchange for a
                 small return.Due to over exposure of internet proper parenting for children has become
                 impossible.More time in pc or screen causes problem in blood circulation and health of
                 individual,They snacks a lot and donot do exercises which will automaically causes a serious health
                problems. <br><br>

                 Every thing has their own positive and negative aspects so we should try to grab the positive
                 aspects to make ourselves better.
